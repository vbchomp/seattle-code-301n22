# React and Forms

## Feedback

#### The Good

- Overall Folks are happy with
  - Curriculum
  - Instructor
  - Lectures (overal)
  - Remo / lab help
  - Grading, Fizzo and his feedback!
- Code Challenges

#### The Imporovables

- Prework - career stuff, a lot, time
  - 201n22 students new because I wouldn't stop going on about it - sorry not all got that
  - not needing canvas access is important
  - Prework is so much, in part, becuase of the first few cohorts-who-took-this-class's feedback
  - **action:** Code Fellows needs to do better with communicating to 301 students about feedback
- Reading
  - **callout:** **con** It's a lot!
  - **callout:** **pro** BUT it is more focused
  - **advice:** make them useful to you.  Does all reading need to be consum,ed 100%?
- Question asking / same people asking questions / speaking over others / Mic interuptions
  - **truth:** I have also found it difficult to get words in edge-wise and deliver lecture content in my own darn lecture! Alos, the fractured nature of the lecture is NOT getting my points across to all students.  You all deserve seamlessly delivered content.
  - **truth:** my previous philosphy has always been have a question ask by however most comfortable
  - **truth:** if someone's voice isn't being heard because of my previous philosophy, THAT is a problem.  human equity mandates that all voices be heard - equally
  - **course of action** from here forward, *we will raise hands* for any questions or comments
  - **course of action:** professional Zoom protocols must be followed, mute yourself when not talking.  keep yourself muted, unless it is your turn to speak.  this will make interuption a conscious choice; don't iterrupt.
  - **typos/questions:**  consider placing a stamp on the screen.  If you  place a mark, also remove your mark once resolved
- time.... yes, it is always against us
- not all resources for CC's as helpful for everyone..  people on both sides for example don't like videos do like videos 
  - **advice:** do wht works for you

## Overview

Today we will cover how React handles `forms` and the asynchronous nature of setting state.

## Daily Plan

- Warm-up exercise
- Review code challenges
- Introduction of today's code challenge topic, `.sort()`
- Code Demo
- Lab Preview

## Learning Objectives

As a result of completing lecture 4 of Code 301, students will:

- Describe and Define:
  - Event
  - Forms
  - Event Listeners
  - Event Handlers
  - event.target
- Understand how to use a `form` in a React application
- Be able to send information collected from a form into a child component

## Notes

1. What is the difference between an event listener and an event handler?

1. If I am listening for an onChange on the input field, how to I access the value that the user is typing in?

1. If the form is my child component, how do I send the information collected from that form up to the parent component?
